# F1Fantasy2022
This is me trying to learn to get python, html and javascript.
The python script goes and scrapes the F1 website for the points of 5 drivers that me and my family picked as out fantasy teams.
Then the python script then updates a html templet and then open the html and boom its all pretty.
